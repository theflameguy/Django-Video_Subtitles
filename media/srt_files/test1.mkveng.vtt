02:33.596 --> 02:36.746
If you wants a good looking guy
in the White House, vote for me babe.

02:36.985 --> 02:42.267
I can't go to the polls 'til I get the wood
all chopped for the winter.

02:42.609 --> 02:45.458

03:23.637 --> 03:25.294
Okay, Olive!

03:53.900 --> 03:55.518
Plowing's all done.

03:56.075 --> 03:57.107

03:57.489 --> 03:59.362

03:59.736 --> 04:02.202
