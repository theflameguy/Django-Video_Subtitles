00:01.137 --> 00:03.104
Geez, I can't believe we found
a version of Earth

00:03.139 --> 00:05.306
with a "Ball Fondlers"
movie franchise.

00:05.341 --> 00:08.576
I can't believe the things
this reality considers PG-13.

00:08.611 --> 00:11.312
- Yeah. I-I'm pretty jealous.
- Don't be, Morty.

00:11.347 --> 00:14.215
There's pros and cons to
every alternate timeline

00:14.250 --> 00:15.483
fun facts about this one--

00:15.518 --> 00:18.353
It's got giant, telepathic
spiders, 11 9/11s,

00:18.387 --> 00:22.433
and the best ice cream
in the multiverse!

00:22.468 --> 00:25.003
- Shut up!
- We go get some ice cream, mother[bleep]!

00:27.006 --> 00:28.306
Oh, great.

00:28.374 --> 00:29.908
Oh, boy.
W-what's wrong, Rick?

00:29.942 --> 00:31.743
Is it the quantum carburetor
or something?

00:31.777 --> 00:33.878
"Quantum carburetor"?
Jesus, Morty.

00:33.913 --> 00:35.547
You can't just add
a--

00:35.581 --> 00:37.849
Sci-Fi word to a car word
and hope it means something.

00:37.883 --> 00:40.323
Huh, looks like something's wrong
with the microverse battery.

00:40.352 --> 00:43.588
- We're gonna have to go inside.
- Um, go inside what?

00:43.622 --> 00:45.456
The battery, Morty.
Be right back, Summer.

00:45.524 --> 00:46.891
Stay put,
don't touch any buttons,

00:46.959 --> 00:50.328
and ignore all random thoughts
that feel... spidery.

00:50.362 --> 00:51.763
Wait!
You can't leave me here!

00:51.797 --> 00:54.499
You'll be fine.
Ship, keep Summer safe.

00:54.533 --> 00:56.501
<i>Keep Summer safe.</i>

00:56.535 --> 00:57.669
Ohh!

00:59.471 --> 01:01.039
Ugh.
Wonderful.

01:05.477 --> 01:07.512
Hey, excuse me.
Hello.

01:07.580 --> 01:09.581
Um...

01:09.615 --> 01:11.583
What, you think
you're better than me?!

01:11.617 --> 01:13.651
Nobody's better than me!

01:13.686 --> 01:14.886
Hey!
Hey!

01:19.124 --> 01:20.925
Aah!
Aaaaah!

01:20.960 --> 01:22.460
<i>- Keep Summer safe.</i>
- Aaaaaaah!

01:22.528 --> 01:23.728
Hey, man, what the hell?!

01:23.796 --> 01:25.830
That was my daughter's
pediatrician! Aah!

01:25.865 --> 01:27.632
No, stop!
Don't kill him!

01:27.666 --> 01:28.967
<i>Confirmed.</i>

01:29.001 --> 01:30.468
Aah!

01:31.670 --> 01:33.338
Oh, God.
I can't feel my legs.

01:33.372 --> 01:34.606
Help!
Help!!

01:34.640 --> 01:37.342
<i>- Summer is safe.</i>
- I don't feel safe.

01:37.376 --> 01:39.043
<i>Confirmed.</i>

01:39.111 --> 01:41.412
No.

01:41.480 --> 01:42.981
Oh, God, help me.
Help me!

01:43.015 --> 01:44.983
Help me, please!
You can help me!

02:18.384 --> 02:20.385
Oh, man.
Where are we, Rick?

02:20.419 --> 02:21.819
Morty, remember
eight seconds ago

02:21.854 --> 02:23.454
when when you said,
"Go inside what?"

02:23.489 --> 02:24.923
And I said, "The battery"?

02:24.957 --> 02:26.624
And then we showed up here,
and I wasn't like,

02:26.692 --> 02:27.892
"Whoa, this is unexpected.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.894
This is not what I was
expecting, Morty.

02:29.962 --> 02:31.529
- What a perplexing mystery this is."
- All right, all right.

02:31.597 --> 02:33.464
We're inside the battery.
I get it.

02:33.499 --> 02:35.500
- You don't have to bust my balls.
- Huh, this isn't right.

02:35.534 --> 02:36.868
This pipe's supposed
to be sending

02:36.902 --> 02:39.671
20 terawatts of juice
up to the engine, Morty.

02:39.705 --> 02:41.506
Instead we've got... zero?

02:41.540 --> 02:42.807
Now what
are these people doing?

02:42.841 --> 02:45.143
W-w-w-whoa, people?

02:45.177 --> 02:46.844
It's time for some
hands-on engine repair.

02:46.912 --> 02:49.647
- All right, Morty, hold on to something.
- Whoa!

02:52.017 --> 02:53.518
Holy crap!

02:53.552 --> 02:54.819
I thought we were inside
your car battery, Rick.

02:54.853 --> 02:58.089
T-t-this is like a whole
p-planet or something.

02:58.123 --> 03:00.024
Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty proud
of this bad boy.

03:00.059 --> 03:01.426
Check it out.

03:01.493 --> 03:05.430
I put a spatially tessellated void
inside a modified temporal field

03:05.497 --> 03:07.865
until a planet developed
intelligent life.

03:07.900 --> 03:10.902
I then introduced that life
to the wonders of electricity,

03:10.970 --> 03:12.837
which they now generate
on a global scale.

03:12.871 --> 03:14.706
And, you know, some of it goes
to power my engine

03:14.740 --> 03:15.974
and charge my phone and stuff.

03:16.009 --> 03:18.509
You have a whole planet sitting
around making your power for you?

03:18.544 --> 03:19.811
That's slavery.

03:19.845 --> 03:21.980
It's society.
They work for each other, Morty.

03:22.014 --> 03:23.915
They pay each other.
They buy houses.

03:23.949 --> 03:25.650
They get married
and make children

03:25.684 --> 03:27.085
that replace them when they get
too old to make power.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.187
That just sounds like slavery
with extra steps.

03:29.221 --> 03:32.156
Ooh-la-la, someone's
gonna get laid in college.

03:32.191 --> 03:34.559
It appears we are
being revisited

03:34.593 --> 03:37.495
by the alien known as Rick,
who once gave our world

03:37.529 --> 03:39.597
the gift of gooble box
technology,

03:39.631 --> 03:42.133
which, when stomped on,
generates electricity,

03:42.167 --> 03:43.801
powering our homes
and businesses,

03:43.836 --> 03:45.503
improving our daily lives,
while safely removing

03:45.537 --> 03:50.108
the dangerous waste power
to a special disposal volcano.

03:50.175 --> 03:51.809
But why has Rick returned?

03:51.844 --> 03:54.445
And what will he say
when he hears the big news?

03:54.480 --> 03:56.080
Let's find out.

03:56.115 --> 03:58.483
You need to tell these people
they're in a battery, Rick.

03:58.550 --> 04:00.985
It's messed up.
There's caterers down there.

04:01.020 --> 04:03.187
Th-th-they're setting up
chafing dishes.

04:03.222 --> 04:04.279
Would you relax, Morty?

04:04.304 --> 04:06.624
There's nothing dishonest
about what we're doing.

04:06.658 --> 04:08.192
Now slap on these antennae.

04:08.227 --> 04:10.094
- These people need to think we're aliens.
- What? Why?

04:10.129 --> 04:14.032
Obviously you really
know nothing about car repair.

04:18.137 --> 04:20.138
Wait for the ramp, Morty.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.806
They love the slow ramp.

04:21.874 --> 04:24.709
Really gets their dicks hard
when they see this ramp

04:24.777 --> 04:27.011
just slowly extending down.

04:28.847 --> 04:31.282
Greetings!

04:32.751 --> 04:34.218
Morty, you got
to flip them off.

04:34.286 --> 04:36.220
I told them it means
"Peace among worlds."

04:36.288 --> 04:37.588
How hilarious is that?

04:44.029 --> 04:45.229
Coming through.

04:45.264 --> 04:47.498
Two real aliens walking
through here.

04:47.566 --> 04:49.500
Rick, our alien friend.

04:49.568 --> 04:51.669
Uh, Mr. President,
um, couldn't help but notice

04:51.703 --> 04:53.838
that you were having problems
generating power.

04:53.872 --> 04:56.207
That's correct.
We've evolved.

04:56.241 --> 04:59.677
Our most brilliant scientist,
Zeep Xanflorp,

04:59.711 --> 05:01.512
has developed
a source of energy

05:01.547 --> 05:03.281
that makes gooble boxes
obsolete.

05:04.783 --> 05:06.017
I would love to see it.

05:06.051 --> 05:08.786
[Bleep] you.
What did you say to me?!

05:08.821 --> 05:09.921
"[Bleep] you."

05:09.988 --> 05:12.790
Y-you told me
it means "much obliged".

05:12.825 --> 05:15.860
Oh. Right.
Uh, b-blow me.

05:15.894 --> 05:17.595
No, no, no.
Blow <i>me</i>.

05:21.834 --> 05:25.903
Zeep, you have an honored guest
from beyond the stars.

05:25.938 --> 05:28.858
I said 12 quantum stabilizers,
not 11.

05:28.882 --> 05:30.582
Fix it or it's your ass.

05:30.628 --> 05:32.161
Chris, I'm in the middle
of something.

05:32.196 --> 05:35.531
Zeep, is Rick--
The alien.

05:35.566 --> 05:37.033
Rick the alien.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.435
Rick the alien...

05:39.470 --> 05:41.037
Really?
You're gonna pull that move?

05:41.071 --> 05:42.739
I guided
your entire civilization.

05:42.773 --> 05:44.841
Your people have
a holiday named Ricksgiving.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.476
They teach kids
about me in school.

05:46.510 --> 05:47.677
I dropped out of school.

05:47.711 --> 05:49.045
It's not a place
for smart people.

05:49.079 --> 05:50.947
Ohhhh, snap!

05:50.981 --> 05:52.882
Listen to me,
you arrogant little--

05:52.916 --> 05:56.052
R-Rick was hoping
to see your new energy source.

05:56.086 --> 05:59.088
I think he could learn
a lot from you, Zeep.

05:59.123 --> 06:00.590
Fine.

06:00.624 --> 06:02.692
It's hard for people to grasp,

06:02.726 --> 06:05.695
but inside that container is
an infinite universe

06:05.729 --> 06:09.132
with a planet capable of generating
massive amounts of power.

06:09.166 --> 06:11.501
I call it a miniverse.

06:11.535 --> 06:13.569
Dumb name.

06:13.637 --> 06:14.971
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

06:15.005 --> 06:17.140
I mean, it's hard
for us to comprehend all this.

06:17.174 --> 06:19.876
Would it be possible
for us to get some kind of tour

06:19.910 --> 06:21.744
of your miniverse
from the inside?

06:21.779 --> 06:23.701
This isn't a [bleep]
chocolate factory.

06:23.726 --> 06:24.614
I don't have time.

06:24.648 --> 06:27.150
Didn't you say time goes
more slowly in the miniverse

06:27.184 --> 06:28.651
relative to the real world?

06:28.686 --> 06:31.020
Yes, Chris.
Thanks for reminding me of that.

06:31.055 --> 06:33.556
Great president.
All right, let's go.

06:33.590 --> 06:35.091
Whoa-oh!

06:35.159 --> 06:36.259
Hold on to something.

06:37.811 --> 06:40.012
I put an unbounded vacuum
inside a temporal field

06:40.047 --> 06:41.614
until a world developed.

06:41.648 --> 06:43.583
I then introduced
the people of this world

06:43.617 --> 06:46.853
to the wonders of electricity
in the form of a device

06:46.887 --> 06:48.588
I call a flooble crank.

06:48.622 --> 06:50.022
What they don't know is

06:50.057 --> 06:53.192
that 80% of every crank's
energy output gets channeled

06:53.260 --> 06:55.728
out of the miniverse
to be used by us.

06:55.796 --> 06:57.296
No more gooble boxes.

06:57.331 --> 06:59.265
I got to tell you, Zeep,
with no disrespect,

06:59.299 --> 07:01.667
I really think what
you're doing here is unethical.

07:01.702 --> 07:03.136
- It's not cool.
- What?!

07:03.170 --> 07:06.105
Y-y-you got the people
on this world slaving away

07:06.140 --> 07:07.840
making your power.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.342
I mean,
that's what I call slavery.

07:09.376 --> 07:11.277
No, no, no,
they work for each other

07:11.311 --> 07:13.546
in exchange for money,
which they then--

07:13.580 --> 07:16.749
Well, that just sounds like
slavery with extra steps.

07:16.784 --> 07:20.586
Eek barba dirkle, somebody's
gonna get laid in college.

07:20.621 --> 07:21.888
Rick, a word?

07:21.922 --> 07:23.022
What the hell was that?

07:23.056 --> 07:24.824
I know.
"Eek barba dirkle"?

07:24.858 --> 07:26.626
That's a pretty
[bleep] up "ooh-la-la".

07:26.660 --> 07:28.294
No, what are you doing
telling this guy

07:28.328 --> 07:29.962
that his miniverse is
unethical?

07:29.997 --> 07:32.098
Do you not see
the hypocrisy here?

07:32.132 --> 07:34.000
Holy crap.
You're right, Morty.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.601
Hypocrisy.

07:35.636 --> 07:37.737
Somewhere on this planet,
there's got to be

07:37.771 --> 07:40.039
an arrogant scientist prick on the
verge of microverse technology,

07:40.107 --> 07:42.341
which would threaten to make
Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete,

07:42.376 --> 07:44.143
forcing Zeep to say
microverses are bad,

07:44.178 --> 07:47.046
at which point he'll realize
what a hypocrite he's being,

07:47.080 --> 07:49.982
his people will go back to
stomping on their gooble boxes,

07:50.017 --> 07:52.351
and you and I will be
on ice cream street, baby!

07:52.386 --> 07:54.187
Eating that mother[bleep]
ice cream!

07:54.221 --> 07:56.188
Slurping, slurping,
slurping it up.

07:56.990 --> 07:58.391
Wh-wh-why are you making
that face?

07:58.425 --> 07:59.859
Holy [bleep]!

07:59.893 --> 08:00.949
It's me.

08:00.974 --> 08:02.995
I've convinced the people of
this planet that I'm a traveler

08:03.029 --> 08:03.996
from another world.

08:04.031 --> 08:05.998
You don't think that's
overdoing it a little?

08:06.033 --> 08:07.667
I mean, you could achieve
the same effect

08:07.701 --> 08:08.968
with a pair of--
Never mind.

08:09.002 --> 08:10.403
You know what?
I shouldn't be so critical.

08:10.437 --> 08:11.804
I'm an alien.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.840
Places, please.
We're about to land.

08:17.177 --> 08:19.745
Too fast.

08:22.382 --> 08:25.718
<i>Law enforcement
converging on location.</i>

08:25.752 --> 08:26.986
<i>Keep Summer safe.</i>

08:27.020 --> 08:29.388
No! No, no!
Don't hurt anybody!

08:29.423 --> 08:32.391
<i>Confirm custom defense protocol--</i>

08:32.426 --> 08:35.194
<i>Keep Summer safe--

08:35.229 --> 08:37.512
- Yes.
- <i>Processing.</i>

08:37.547 --> 08:40.282
Come out of the vehicle
with your hands in the air!

08:40.316 --> 08:42.050
<i>Scanning assailants.</i>

08:44.987 --> 08:47.389
<i>Psychological option detected.</i>

08:47.423 --> 08:49.491
<i>Gestating.</i>

08:49.525 --> 08:50.859
"Gestating"?

08:50.893 --> 08:54.462
Come out with your hands up,
or we will be forced to open fire!

08:55.631 --> 08:57.260
- Incoming!
- We got a device!

08:57.285 --> 08:58.414
Bomb! Bomb!

09:01.304 --> 09:02.504
Daddy?

09:02.538 --> 09:04.506
Oh, my God.

09:04.540 --> 09:06.174
- Hunter?
- Daddy?

09:06.208 --> 09:07.943
What the hell?

09:07.977 --> 09:10.278
Jesus Christ,
cease fire! Stay back!

09:10.313 --> 09:11.446
H-h-hunter?

09:11.480 --> 09:13.248
- Daddy.
- Hunter!

09:13.282 --> 09:15.250
Oh, my dear, sweet God, Hunter.

09:15.284 --> 09:16.585
Oh, my boy.
My boy.

09:16.652 --> 09:19.054
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It was all my fault.

09:19.088 --> 09:21.256
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy, leave the car alone.

09:21.290 --> 09:22.424
W-w-w-what?

09:22.491 --> 09:24.526
Leave the car alone.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.194
Hunter?
Don't--

09:26.228 --> 09:27.329
Oh, my God.

09:27.363 --> 09:29.631
Stay here, Hunter!
No!

09:29.665 --> 09:32.567
God, no!
Hunter!

09:34.070 --> 09:36.371
<i>All of you have loved ones.</i>

09:36.405 --> 09:39.007
<i>All can be returned.
All can be taken away.</i>

09:39.075 --> 09:41.309
<i>Please step away
from the vehicle.</i>

09:42.278 --> 09:44.613
<i>Keep Summer safe.</i>

09:44.647 --> 09:47.415
And if you continue
to turn your flooble cranks,

09:47.483 --> 09:50.118
I will bring you
other great alien advancements.

09:50.152 --> 09:52.454
- Hey, uh, let me ask you something.
- Yes?

09:52.488 --> 09:55.056
Any of your, uh, scientists
working on anything new?

09:55.124 --> 09:56.591
All of them.
That's their job.

09:56.626 --> 09:59.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But I mean, like, energy-wise.

09:59.128 --> 10:01.496
Anyone working on, say,
a little universe in a box?

10:01.530 --> 10:03.632
How do you know about that?
It's top secret.

10:03.699 --> 10:07.569
So remember-- a crank
a day is not nearly enough.

10:07.603 --> 10:09.270
Crank it.

10:09.338 --> 10:12.107
I told them this means
"Peace among worlds".

10:12.141 --> 10:15.210
- How hilarious is that?
- Re-really funny, Zeep.

10:15.244 --> 10:17.579
Hey, Zeep, the fake president
of your fake world

10:17.613 --> 10:19.681
has something fake important
to show you.

10:22.151 --> 10:23.052
It's not much now,

10:23.077 --> 10:25.454
but once I learn to accelerate
the temporal field,

10:25.488 --> 10:27.622
I'll be able to interact
with any sentient life

10:27.657 --> 10:29.457
that evolves and introduce them

10:29.492 --> 10:32.227
to the wonders of electricity
via a pulley-based device

10:32.294 --> 10:33.495
I call a blooble yank.

10:33.529 --> 10:35.897
But what
they won't know is--

10:35.965 --> 10:37.666
You'll be taking
most of their energy.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.234
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.

10:39.268 --> 10:41.603
It's showtime.

10:45.374 --> 10:48.943
You do realize this will make
the flooble crank obsolete?

10:48.978 --> 10:52.280
This is wrong, Kyle.
What you're doing is wrong.

10:52.348 --> 10:54.582
You're basically--
This is slavery.

10:54.617 --> 10:57.118
You're talking about creating
a planet of slaves.

10:57.153 --> 11:00.455
- Told you, Zeep.
- Oh, they won't be slaves.

11:00.489 --> 11:02.624
They'll work for each other
and pay each other money.

11:02.658 --> 11:07.696
That just sounds like slavery
with ex... tra... steps.

11:07.730 --> 11:09.497
- What?
- Wait a minute.

11:09.532 --> 11:12.167
Did you create my universe?
Is my universe a miniverse?

11:12.234 --> 11:14.502
- Microverse!
- Uh, teenyverse.

11:14.537 --> 11:16.337
Ugh!
You bastard!

11:16.405 --> 11:18.473
Much obliged.

11:18.497 --> 11:20.997
- What the hell is happening?
- This is healthy, trust me.

11:21.177 --> 11:23.011
You're my battery, mother[bleep].

11:23.045 --> 11:24.312
That's all you are.

11:24.346 --> 11:26.314
I made you.
Your microverse sucks!

11:26.338 --> 11:28.938
And your miniverse is the size
of a [bleep] lobster tank!

11:28.962 --> 11:29.718
It's whack!

11:29.719 --> 11:32.020
Are they not really aliens?

11:32.088 --> 11:36.191
Nah, they're just a couple of crazy,
wacky scientists, you know?

11:36.225 --> 11:37.592
So he made a universe,

11:37.626 --> 11:39.294
and that guy is
from <i>that</i> universe.

11:39.328 --> 11:41.629
And that guy made a universe.

11:41.664 --> 11:45.233
And that's the universe
where I was born.

11:45.267 --> 11:47.469
Where my father died.

11:47.503 --> 11:49.704
Where I couldn't make time
for his funeral

11:49.772 --> 11:54.209
because I was working
on my universe.

11:54.243 --> 11:56.010
- I made you!
- Yeah.

11:56.045 --> 11:57.712
Science, huh?
Ain't it a thing.

11:57.747 --> 12:00.048
You know, one time,
Rick sh-- accidentally shot

12:00.082 --> 12:01.683
his laser pistol
right through my hand.

12:01.717 --> 12:05.286
You know, I mean, like,
old-lady science, you know?

12:05.321 --> 12:07.122
She's a real--

12:07.156 --> 12:08.456
You got to hang on tight,
you know?

12:08.491 --> 12:11.292
Because she-- she'll--
She bucks pretty hard.

12:11.327 --> 12:14.329
Ooh, boy, what--
Oh, my God, no!

12:19.301 --> 12:20.435
- Teenyverse.
- Teenyverse.

12:22.152 --> 12:24.119
Come on, come on, come on.

12:24.154 --> 12:25.254
Pterodactyl!

12:25.989 --> 12:27.290
Asshole!

12:27.324 --> 12:28.925
When I get
out of this teenyverse,

12:28.959 --> 12:30.827
I'm gonna smash it to pieces
with you in it.

12:30.861 --> 12:32.562
Yeah, well, when I get
out of this teenyverse,

12:32.596 --> 12:34.430
I'm gonna get out of
the surrounding miniverse

12:34.465 --> 12:36.399
and then the microverse
around that, and guess what?

12:36.433 --> 12:37.900
Don't make things worse, Rick!

12:37.935 --> 12:39.902
Uh, he's not gonna destroy
your universe.

12:39.937 --> 12:41.904
You know, we--
We need it to start our car.

12:41.939 --> 12:44.273
That's what you used
my universe for?

12:44.308 --> 12:45.942
To run your car?

12:45.976 --> 12:47.343
Yeah, but don't
flatter yourself.

12:47.378 --> 12:50.079
There's always AAA,
you [bleep] [bleep]sucker!

12:51.148 --> 12:53.015
What's he doing?
What's he crafting?

12:53.050 --> 12:54.517
I can craft stuff, too, pal!

12:54.551 --> 12:56.386
Just like I crafted
your reality!

12:57.654 --> 12:59.055
You crafty son of a--

12:59.089 --> 13:00.289
Ow!

13:00.324 --> 13:03.926
I crafted the guy that created
the planet you're standing on!

13:03.961 --> 13:06.362
Yeah, and I made the stars that became
the carbon in your mother's ovaries!

13:06.397 --> 13:08.164
I didn't ask to be born!

13:08.198 --> 13:09.599
All right, that's it!
I'm out.

13:09.633 --> 13:11.467
I-I'm gonna go
into the wilderness,

13:11.502 --> 13:14.470
and I'm gonna make a new life for
myself among the tree people.

13:14.505 --> 13:16.906
- It can't be worse than this.
- Sure. Okay, Morty.

13:16.940 --> 13:19.342
Just be back before sundown
or the tree people will eat you.

13:19.409 --> 13:20.376
That's a myth!

13:20.411 --> 13:22.311
W-w-why are you trying
to start a myth?

13:22.346 --> 13:23.880
It's a prehistoric planet, Morty.

13:23.947 --> 13:25.448
Someone has to bring
a little culture.

13:25.482 --> 13:27.116
And it certainly can't be someone

13:27.151 --> 13:30.286
whose entire culture powers
my brake lights!

13:32.923 --> 13:34.856
Go, go, go!

13:35.856 --> 13:37.857
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

13:37.881 --> 13:39.581
What are we going to do now?

13:39.592 --> 13:42.427
<i>I am unable
to destroy this army.</i>

13:42.461 --> 13:45.864
<i>To clarify, I am quite able
to destroy this army,</i>

13:45.898 --> 13:48.132
- <i>but you will not permit it.</i>
- Correct.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.502
<i>You also refuse to authorize
emotional countermeasures.</i>

13:51.537 --> 13:54.505
If you're talking
about the melting ghost babies,

13:54.540 --> 13:56.474
yes, please, no more of that.

13:56.508 --> 13:58.476
<i>Confirmed.</i>

13:58.536 --> 14:01.536
<i>I am currently constructing
a security measure</i>

14:01.547 --> 14:03.414
<i>in compliance
with your parameters.</i>

14:03.449 --> 14:06.751
<i>But I do want to say
you are not making this easy.</i>

14:06.819 --> 14:08.353
You know you're
kind of a dick, right?

14:08.387 --> 14:11.389
<i>My function is
to keep Summer safe,</i>

14:11.423 --> 14:14.525
<i>not keep Summer being,
like, totally stoked</i>

14:14.560 --> 14:17.462
<i>about, like,
the general vibe and stuff.</i>

14:17.496 --> 14:20.164
<i>That's you.
That's how you talk.</i>

14:23.702 --> 14:26.171
Hey, that's my deer!

14:27.706 --> 14:29.174
Aaaaaaah!

14:29.208 --> 14:30.508
Raah!

14:30.576 --> 14:33.611
I hope your God is
as big a dick as you.

14:36.649 --> 14:39.250
My God's the biggest dick
that's never existed.

14:39.285 --> 14:41.152
Why do you think I'm even here?

14:43.532 --> 14:45.198
You're here

14:45.233 --> 14:47.401
because you created
someone smarter than you.

14:49.804 --> 14:53.373
Oh, I thought we were both here because
I created a universe of idiots.

14:59.847 --> 15:02.449
Kalo kada sha la.

15:02.483 --> 15:03.583
Holy shit.
Morty?

15:03.618 --> 15:05.252
I haven't seen you in months.

15:05.286 --> 15:06.820
You're leading the tree people?

15:06.854 --> 15:08.288
Huh.
That's a step up.

15:08.322 --> 15:09.489
We have no leaders.

15:09.557 --> 15:12.125
We follow
only the will of the forest.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.293
Ooh. Wow.

15:13.327 --> 15:16.363
- Gaaaaay.
- That is pretty gay.

15:16.397 --> 15:18.231
You two call yourselves
geniuses,

15:18.266 --> 15:20.867
but you have spent
this time learning nothing.

15:20.902 --> 15:22.769
Come with me into the forest.

15:22.804 --> 15:25.338
There is something
I wish to teach you.

15:28.743 --> 15:32.379
This is ku'ala,
the spirit tree.

15:32.413 --> 15:34.347
For generations,
it has guided the--

15:35.550 --> 15:37.684
You have to get us
the [bleep] out of here.

15:37.718 --> 15:39.553
These people are
backwards savages.

15:39.587 --> 15:41.188
They eat every third baby

15:41.222 --> 15:43.356
because they think
it makes fruit grow bigger.

15:43.391 --> 15:45.892
Everyone's gross, and they all
smell like piss all the time.

15:45.927 --> 15:48.495
I m-- I miss my family.
I miss my laptop.

15:48.563 --> 15:51.765
I masturbated to an extra-curvy
piece of driftwood the other day!

15:51.799 --> 15:53.500
Look, I don't care
what it takes.

15:53.534 --> 15:55.202
You two are putting aside
your bull[bleep],

15:55.236 --> 15:57.571
and you're working together
to get us back home.

15:57.605 --> 15:59.506
No can do, Morty.
I just can't.

15:59.540 --> 16:01.341
I just don't see how I can--

16:01.375 --> 16:02.642
Ro ro dah no gah!

16:02.677 --> 16:05.412
You're smart.
You'll figure it out.

16:05.446 --> 16:09.549
You have 10
seconds to get out of the ship!

16:09.584 --> 16:11.485
10, 9...

16:12.487 --> 16:13.753
All right, not bad.

16:13.788 --> 16:15.856
I guess you're
an okay proto recombinator.

16:15.923 --> 16:18.458
I've certainly seen
worse ionic cell dioxination.

16:18.493 --> 16:20.160
If this works,
drinks are on me.

16:20.194 --> 16:21.862
If drinks are on you,
you're gonna need

16:21.929 --> 16:23.597
a second mortgage
on that tower.

16:23.631 --> 16:25.132
I'm an alcoholic.

16:25.199 --> 16:26.700
Opium addict.

16:28.936 --> 16:31.538
All right, okay, okay,
okay, wrap it up.

16:31.606 --> 16:34.441
You guys are the [bleep] worst!
Your gods are a lie!

16:34.509 --> 16:36.943
[Bleep] you, [bleep] nature,
and [bleep] trees!

16:39.514 --> 16:40.747
Yes! You did it!
Yes!

16:40.781 --> 16:42.516
Hey, uh, how about that drink?

16:42.550 --> 16:45.619
Sure, I just need to go grab
my wallet from inside my ship.

16:45.653 --> 16:47.187
Isour wallet in your ship?

16:47.255 --> 16:50.223
That's where the transporter is,
too, so why don't we come with?

16:50.258 --> 16:53.437
It's cool.
I'll be back in a sec.

16:53.472 --> 16:56.941
You know how long a second can
take in a microverse?

16:56.975 --> 16:58.976
Oh!
Run, Morty!

16:59.011 --> 17:01.312
That asshole's willing to risk everything
he cares about just to defeat me!

17:01.346 --> 17:02.480
He's psychotic!

17:05.384 --> 17:07.685
- Morty, hop on my back.
- Why?

17:07.719 --> 17:10.054
Go, go Sanchez ski shoes.

17:11.757 --> 17:13.891
Aaaaaah!
...Eight...

17:15.027 --> 17:16.327
Aaaah!
Oof!

17:17.729 --> 17:19.697
Hold still.

17:20.999 --> 17:24.669
Oh, hey, guys. I just
finished cooking us a feast.

17:24.703 --> 17:26.470
Aaaah!
Holy--

17:26.505 --> 17:28.673
- You monster!
- Whoa. Bad tour.

17:28.707 --> 17:30.374
...seven...

17:30.442 --> 17:32.009
Hey, you got to sign out.

17:32.077 --> 17:34.545
Nothing you do matters!
Your existence is a lie!

17:34.613 --> 17:38.382
If that were
really true, then...

17:38.450 --> 17:40.451
- I'm here to see Ron Mendleson.
- Third floor.

17:40.485 --> 17:41.986
Would you like
to go to dinner with--

17:42.020 --> 17:43.788
Uh, no.

17:46.458 --> 17:49.927
You may have created this
universe, Rick, but I live in it.

17:49.962 --> 17:51.462
[Bleep]

17:51.496 --> 17:53.631
What are we gonna do, Rick?
We're so screwed.

17:53.665 --> 17:55.066
He's gonna get to the
ship and smash the microverse,

17:55.091 --> 17:56.091
and then he's gonna kill us!

17:56.134 --> 17:57.660
Quick, Morty, you've
got to turn into a car.

17:57.685 --> 17:58.169
What?!

17:58.203 --> 18:00.604
A long time ago, I implanted you
with a subdermal chip

18:00.672 --> 18:03.107
that could call upon dormant
nanobots in your bloodstream

18:03.141 --> 18:05.509
to restructure your anatomy
and turn you into a car.

18:05.544 --> 18:06.777
- Oh, my God!
- Concentrate, Morty.

18:06.812 --> 18:08.332
Concentrate and turn
into a car, Morty.

18:09.815 --> 18:11.615
Never mind. Here's a taxi.
Get in. It's fine.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.117
...six...

18:15.821 --> 18:16.954
- Hey, Zeep.
- Huh?

18:16.989 --> 18:19.690
Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch.

18:19.725 --> 18:21.826
Aaah!

18:21.860 --> 18:23.527
We did it, Morty.

18:23.562 --> 18:25.096
Now let's get out of here
and destroy this whole universe.

18:25.130 --> 18:26.464
Excuse me?

18:26.498 --> 18:27.898
...five--

18:27.933 --> 18:29.600
Sir?

18:31.503 --> 18:32.937
- Holy hell.
- Sir!

18:34.106 --> 18:35.206
Hold you fire!

18:37.976 --> 18:39.744
What's going on?

18:39.778 --> 18:41.512
<i>I have brokered
a peace agreement</i>

18:41.546 --> 18:43.614
<i>between the giant spiders
and the government.</i>

18:43.648 --> 18:47.051
Thanks to the skilled diplomacy
of this mysterious space car,

18:47.085 --> 18:49.987
from this day forward,
human- and spiderkind will live

18:50.022 --> 18:51.856
side by side in peace.

18:51.923 --> 18:54.692
We will stop bombing them,
and they will no longer use

18:54.726 --> 18:56.761
their telepathic abilities
to make us wander into webs

18:56.828 --> 18:58.462
for later consumption.

18:58.497 --> 19:00.564
Instead, we will work together
to make this world

19:00.599 --> 19:04.602
a better place for all,
no matter how many legs.

19:04.669 --> 19:06.771
What do we do
about the space car?

19:06.838 --> 19:08.139
Leave it alone.

19:08.173 --> 19:09.807
I mean, what did it
really do, anyways?

19:09.841 --> 19:11.108
Kill a guy
and paralyze his buddy?

19:11.143 --> 19:14.011
Not a bad trade
for spider peace.

19:14.046 --> 19:15.980
All right, that's it.
Move out!

19:20.886 --> 19:23.721
I love this spider!

19:23.789 --> 19:25.489
<i>Summer is safe.</i>

19:25.524 --> 19:26.991
All right, I get it.

19:31.029 --> 19:32.229
Rick!

19:33.999 --> 19:35.566
Don't do it.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.869
You quit school, but you
still got some learning to do.

19:51.049 --> 19:52.683
Aah!

19:52.717 --> 19:54.118
Unh!

20:02.928 --> 20:04.995
Class dismissed.

20:05.030 --> 20:07.264
Geez.

20:15.941 --> 20:17.508
- You all right?
- Uh-huh!

20:17.576 --> 20:18.776
What are you doing, Rick?

20:18.844 --> 20:20.544
I'm pretty sure
the battery's dead.

20:20.579 --> 20:21.879
Oh, you think so, huh, Morty?

20:21.947 --> 20:23.080
Well, let's see.

20:23.115 --> 20:25.983
Hey, wait-- huh?
I don't get it.

20:26.017 --> 20:28.252
Of course you don't.
But Zeep did.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.854
He knew that once I got
back to my car,

20:29.888 --> 20:31.789
one of two things
was gonna happen--

20:31.823 --> 20:33.858
I was gonna have to toss
a broken battery,

20:33.892 --> 20:36.727
or the battery wouldn't
be broken.

20:41.166 --> 20:45.035
Peace among worlds, Rick.

20:45.103 --> 20:46.237
Jesus.

20:46.271 --> 20:48.572
Yeah.
Listen to that baby purr.

20:48.607 --> 20:49.374
You were right, Morty--

20:49.399 --> 20:51.142
We really just needed to
be honest with those guys.

20:51.176 --> 20:52.376
All right, here we go.

20:54.980 --> 20:56.814
Thank y-o-o-ou.

20:56.848 --> 20:58.816
See, Morty?
This is what it's all about.

20:58.850 --> 21:00.284
This is why we do what we do.

21:00.318 --> 21:01.785
- Uh-huh.
- Ew! What the hell?

21:01.853 --> 21:03.954
Jesus!
There's flies in my ice cream.

21:03.989 --> 21:05.222
Presidential decree--

21:05.257 --> 21:09.326
All ice cream is now for all beings,
no matter how many legs.

21:09.361 --> 21:11.428
- What the [bleep] did you do, Summer?!
- It was your ship!

21:11.463 --> 21:13.063
- Your stupid ship did it!
- Don't blame my ship!

21:13.098 --> 21:14.932
- It melted a child!
- My ship doesn't do anything...

21:14.999 --> 21:16.467
- It killed it itself!
- ...unless it's told to do something!

21:16.501 --> 21:18.341
- We almost died!
- I don't want to hear it, Summer!

21:18.370 --> 21:20.404
Your boobs are all hanging about,

21:20.472 --> 21:22.373
and you ruined ice cream
with your boobs out.

21:22.407 --> 21:24.108
And don't even try
to deny it, either.
